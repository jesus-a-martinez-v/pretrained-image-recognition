# Pretrained Image Recognition

Exploration of different pre-trained models to make predictions on Flickr images. For more information, refer to the notebooks and the companion code.

This project is based on the lessons present in Deep Learning Cookbook by Douwe Osinga (O'Reilly), Copyright 2018 Douwe Osinga, 978-1-491-99584-6.

## Getting started

First, you'll need `conda`. Then, create the environment with the following command:

```bash
conda create -n pretrained-image-recognition python=3.6
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
source activate pretrained-image-recognition
```

Finally, install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```    

## Interact with the notebooks

Once in the conda environment, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
